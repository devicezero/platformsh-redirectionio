# This setting allows to define the logging behavior for this instance. If it is set to "true", the instance will
# be marked as allowed to log traffic. If it is set to "false", the instance will not collect traffic logs.
# If this setting is not defined, or defined with any other value than "true" or "false", it will be managed
# by the value defined in the manager graphical interface. Else, this setting takes precedence over the logging
# behavior defined in the manager graphical interface.
